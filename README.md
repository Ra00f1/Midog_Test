# A Test on MIDOG++
Dataset link: https://github.com/DeepMicroscopy/MIDOGpp

while I thought a quick small project wouldn't have been a problem, I very soon relished that because I haven't worked with medical images a lot I miss-judged the real problem for newbies, THE SIZE OF THE IMAGES.
on the other hand, one other big problem was that if I segment the images how do I get the coordinates of the outcomes I need with the new segments and what if they get split into a few segments? do I use overlapping segments which would increase training time.
